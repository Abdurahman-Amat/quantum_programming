    This plot shows the training result of the quantum support machine model / algorithm on the 
    training set of **ad-hoc-dataset**. Color strength at each point represents the amplitude of
    the inner product of each pair of vectors in higher dimensional vector space mapped by the
    **ZZFeatureMap** quantum circuit from the Qiskit library.
